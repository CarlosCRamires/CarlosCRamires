  <h2>The Cantino Planisphere</h2>

  <p>
    A copy secretly taken from the Portuguese fifteenth‑century <em>Padrão Real</em> —
    the state‑secret, continuously updated world map produced during
    “Os Descobrimentos”. It stands not only as a reminder of the value of data,
    its confidentiality, access, and control, but also of the inherent risks of
    its leakage.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, it was through such leakage that the Dutch — already deeply engaged
    in espionage across the Indies — came to learn the routes, currents, and
    winds essential to navigation at the time. These developments unfolded
    against the backdrop of the <em>jus imperii lusitani</em>, articulated by
    Serafim de Freitas, the Portuguese doctrine that claimed exclusive dominion
    over the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean and sought to enforce a
    closed‑sea model (<em>mare clausum</em>).
  </p>

  <p>
    It was precisely this framework that Hugo Grotius set out to challenge in
    <em>Mare Liberum</em>, arguing that the seas should be open to all. Together
    with later contributions from jurists such as John Selden and the broader
    British legal tradition, this intellectual contest laid the foundations of
    modern international maritime law.
